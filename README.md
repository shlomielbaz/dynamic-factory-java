Java dynamic factory

This project demonstrates the use of [Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method) in Java programing language, the idea in this example is to create an extensible mechanism where you can add/remove a new handlers, and the system will recognize the changes automatically with zero configuration, this flexibility is obtained thanks to Java reflection mechanism.
